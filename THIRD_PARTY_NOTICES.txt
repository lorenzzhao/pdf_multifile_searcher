Third-party dependency notices
================================

This project depends on the following notable third-party packages. This
file is a short, non-exhaustive notice intended to help you review license
compatibility before distribution. Always refer to the upstream project
pages for the authoritative license texts.

1) PyMuPDF (Python bindings for MuPDF)
   - Purpose: PDF parsing, search, rendering
   - Project: https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/ and https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/
   - License: AGPL-3.0 (Affero GPL) OR commercial license from Artifex Software
   - Notes: PyMuPDF's dual licensing means that using it in distributed
     software can impose AGPL obligations unless a commercial license is
     obtained. If you intend to distribute this application together with
     PyMuPDF or make it available as a network service, consult the PyMuPDF
     licensing terms and, if necessary, contact Artifex for a commercial
     license.

2) tkinter (Tk interface for Python)
   - Purpose: GUI toolkit used by the project
   - Project: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
   - License: Typically follows the Python Software Foundation License for
     CPython and the TCL/TK licenses for the underlying toolkit. Check your
     platform packaging for details. tkinter itself is part of the Python
     standard library.

3) (optional) fontTools, pytesseract, PIL/Pillow
   - Purpose: optional features for fonts and OCR if used
   - Licenses: fontTools (MIT), Pillow (PIL) (PIL fork; HPND or Pillow license),
     Tesseract OCR (Apache 2.0). Confirm each if you enable those features.

Additional dependencies may be present in your environment (for example if
you install optional extras). Always check installed packages and their
licenses before redistribution.

If you need a formal, machine-readable dependency manifest or license
bundling (for compliance), I can generate a `requirements.txt` and collect
the license texts automatically.
