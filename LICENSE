GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
							  Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 authors' reputations.

 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
 individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
 proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
 license obtained for a program must be consistent with the overall
 purpose of protecting users' freedom.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (unless a warranty
 is provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
 and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a
 list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in
 the list meets this requirement.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of
 a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs that are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
 conditions:

	a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
		it, and giving a relevant date.

	b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
		released under this License and any additional terms that you
		applied.

	c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
		to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License
		will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
		additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
		regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
		permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
		invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

	d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
		Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
		interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
		work need not make them do so.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:

	a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
		(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
		written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
		long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
		model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
		copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
		product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
		medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
		more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
		conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
		Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

	b) Provide access to the Corresponding Source from a designated
		place (gratis or for a charge), and accompany the object code
		with a written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.

	c) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
		place (gratis or for a charge), and provide equivalent access to
		the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place
		at no further charge.

	d) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
		you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
		Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
		charge under subsection 6c.

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

Dependency note
---------------
This project depends on PyMuPDF for PDF parsing and rendering. PyMuPDF is
available under AGPL-3.0 or a commercial license from Artifex Software.
Because this project (and PyMuPDF) are AGPL-licensed, distribution of the
combined work must comply with the AGPL-3.0 terms. If you require a
different distribution model, you must obtain a commercial PyMuPDF license
from Artifex or remove/replace PyMuPDF with a library licensed under
compatible terms.
